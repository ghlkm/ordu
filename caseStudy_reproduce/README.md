step1 run case study 
---------
Go to directory /build and run case study as follow command.
```
./iPref -w 1 -k 2 -d 2 -m 6 -f ../data/ast_trb.dat -mt CS -W ../data/user_ast_trb.txt  -n 30000000 -i ../idx/idx1.txt 
```

This case study set 1 input user (-w 1) in user file user_ast_trb.txt,\
k=2, m=6, and a 2d NBA player file (assist and rebounds data).
After execute command as shown above, you will get a file called "result.txt".

--------
step2 run python3 script to draw result 
--------
if your computer don't have python3, you can go to https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
download anaconda with python3.
After download anaconda you will get python3 and a python package manager pip.
Open anaconda prompt and install package numpy and matplotlib as:
```
pip install numpy # sometimes it may be "pip3 install numpy"
pip install matplotlib # sometime it may be "pip3 install matplotlib" 
``` 
  
go to directory /caseStudy_reproduce and run python as follows:
```
python draw.py ../data/ast_trb.dat ./result.txt # sometimes it may be "python3 draw.py ../data/ast_trb.dat ./result.txt"
``` 

You will get the same figure as our paper's Figure 6(a) except players names and correct axis labels.

---------------
To reproduce the case study Figure 6(b), you just need to execute the some command as shown above except
replacing "ast_trb.dat" with "trb_pts.dat", and replacing "user_ast_trb.txt" with "user_trb_pts.txt"

---------------
If you want to change the label of generated figure or save figure, 
you can modify it in draw.py easily.
